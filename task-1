        Differences between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2
      </h1>
      <p>
        HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information
      </p>
      <p>
        first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web. In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. One of the major ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.

        prioritization in HTTP/2 and it's advantages over HTTP/1.1
      </h2>
      <p>
        prioritization refers to the order in which pieces of content are loaded. it affects a webpage's load time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the order in which these page resources load affects how the user perceives page load time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In HTTP/2, developers have hands-on, detailed control over prioritization. This allows them to maximize perceived and actual page load speed to a degree that was not possible in HTTP/1.1.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTTP/2 offers a feature called weighted prioritization.This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time.
      </p>

        Advancement in handling Multiplexing in HTTP/2
      </h2>
      <p>
        HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
      </p>

        Use of Server push in HTTP/2
      </h2>
      <p>
        Typically, a server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it. However, this approach is not always practical for modern webpages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it. The server also sends a message letting the client know what pushed content to expect.
